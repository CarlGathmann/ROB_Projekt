In this project, conducted at the Institute of Robotics and Cognitive Systems at the University of LÃ¼beck, a robotic system was developed to generate haptic feedback for arbitrary .stl files. The robot provides a force-based feedback mechanism that repels any user movement attempting to penetrate the surface defined by the .stl model. Combined with a VR headset, this technology has the potential to create exciting new interactive experiences. A demonstration Video can be found here: https://youtu.be/IhARjkxuTvw.
